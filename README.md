# Sorting Algorithms
This is a series of sorting algorithms for demonstration purposes only.

Currently, it contains implementations of:
+ [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
+ [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)

Algorithms obviously aren't my own working, but the implementations and surrounding code is.
